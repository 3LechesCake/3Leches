Repository to store the Tres Leches Cake Token Digital Asset, Whitepaper and Solidity Contract for the community to contribute as well as other key areas.
Tres Leches Cake is a fascinating and rich one. The idea behind this token is to create a version of this delicious dessert in the cryptocurrency world as a meme token. However, like many memes, we want to give an excellent purpose and utility to the token. Our main goal will be to use the token as a channel to get a potential scholarship for college students. The idea will be to create a scholarship wallet where we will drop 5% of the total supply and select a winner each semester to award the scholarship. We know how hard it is for people to accomplish their goals and how the world makes it harder to attend a good education.
